You can use this through either Discord's desktop app or through the browser.

Instructions are also found as comments in the code.

For lastmsg, go to the message you want the code to start at and 'Copy ID'

For youruser, this is your Discord name. Do not include the # symbol or the four numbers after it.

For authToken, 1. On your browser go to any discord conversation/server. Press F12. 1.On the desktop app, the dev tool key is CTRL + SHIFT + i. 3.Delete a message. Under the 'Network' tab, should be the last entry but look for the shortest entry 4.It should be an entry of JUST numbers 5.Scroll down to 'Request Headers' on the right me 6.Look for 'authorization'. Thats your authToken. DO. NOT. SHARE. THIS. KEY. At all. With anyone.

For channel, this is the ~18 digit number on the url browser version of discord. You will need to acces the conversation through browser to get this number.

The code only tracks how many messages it deletes of yours. You can add a variable like i to keep track of how many messages the other person has sent. This is not necessary, and WILL make your console.log spam. Be careful.
